Author Single Page Site

Files created:
- index.html — main single-page HTML (uses Bootstrap 5 via CDN)
- assets/css/custom.css — small custom styles, Google Fonts
- assets/js/main.js — tiny JS helpers (current year, navbar collapse)

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required for basic testing).
2. Replace placeholder images with images in `assets/img/` and update text.
3. Customize brand colors in `assets/css/custom.css`.

Notes:
- Uses Bootstrap CDN and Google Fonts; you can vendor these if you prefer offline.
- Add real book links and social URLs in `index.html`.

Next steps I can do for you:
- Add sample book JSON and a small script to render book cards dynamically.
- Add an OpenGraph meta image and SEO metadata.
- Replace CDN links with local assets and a small build script.
